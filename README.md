AndroidWearScripts
==================

Do you write code for Android Wear, do much testing, so you know it isn't great fun to do that. There are bunch of moments that you are about to use command like - for example just to connect via Bluetooth to your watch.

###How is it helping?
Just go to folder with main.sh type "./main.sh" to connect to your watch (if no parameter is specified via 4444 port) and generate few other scripts for that connection - list is below.

###Scripts

**screenshot** - it takes a screenshot of your watch screen and automatically send it to your command line location with random name.

**listPackages** - obtain full list of installed software on your Wear.

**install app.apk** - installs app from selected APK.
